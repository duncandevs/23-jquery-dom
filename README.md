## I want a To DO List

+ Submitting a Form should add that note onto the right hand side of the page

### Bonus Challenge

It would be nice if we could delete items from our ToDo list. Build out this functionality.

Each ToDo list item that gets created should have a button. When clicking the button, that item should be removed from the list. Some challenges that you will have to figure out.

  + When the document loads, the ToDo list items won't be there. How can you add an event handler to an item that isn't in the DOM yet?
  + When the button is clicked, how do you know which todo list item the user is trying to destroy?
